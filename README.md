## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains practical C++ examples and exercises inspired by the book *C++ For Dummies* by Stephen R. Davis.  
The goal of this project is to reinforce C++ programming concepts through real, hands-on examples and small programs.  
Each file demonstrates a specific concept from the book — from basic syntax and control flow to classes, pointers, templates, and modern C++ features.

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

By exploring the code in this repository, you’ll gain experience with:

- Setting up a C++ development environment  
- Basic syntax, data types, and variables  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation  
- Working with arrays and strings  
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Templates and the Standard Template Library (STL)  
- Exception handling and file input/output  
- Modern C++ techniques and debugging

## 🧩 Repository Structure

Each chapter or topic from the book is represented by a `.cpp` file.  
The corresponding `.exe` files are included for quick execution and testing.

```
📁 C-Plus-Plus-For-Dummies-by-Stephen-R-Davis-Book-Practice-in-C-Plus-Plus
 ┣ 📜 chapter_1.cpp
 ┣ 📜 chapter_2.cpp
 ┣ 📜 chapter_3.cpp
 ┣ 📜 ...
 ┣ 📜 chapter_27.cpp
 ┗ ⚙️ executables (.exe) for each chapter
```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run the examples, you’ll need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g. `g++`, `clang++`, or Visual Studio)
- C++17 or newer standard support
- Command line or IDE to compile and run `.cpp` files

**Example (Linux/macOS/Windows with g++):**
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 chapter_1.cpp -o chapter_1
./chapter_1
```
